# Measuring the Impact of Advertising: An A/B Testing Analysis on User Engagement and Ad Effectiveness

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to examine the effects of user engagement after seeing Ad A or Ad B


## Problem
An advertising company has developed a new ad to have users engage with their questionnaire. The company has shown the new ad to some users and a dummy ad to others and wants their data analyst team to interpret the results. Does the new ad generate more responses to their questionnaire? Is it statistically significant? Is the company justified in using the new ad? 
 

A/B testing is common in the business world and is a way to compare two versions of something to figure out which performs better. Figuring out which ad users prefer is a real life business problem that would be expected to know how to solve as a business data analyst.
